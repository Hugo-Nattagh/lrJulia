### Data Processing and Linear Regression on a Logo Competitions Dataset

I tried my hand at Julia, which is still a young programming language. Nevertheless I managed to get by, and coming from Python,
it wasn't too much of a hassle to learn the basics.

I got the dataset from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MZUYN3).
